  abstract = {El Per\'u ha experimentado un prolongado y complejo proceso de mestizaje desde el inicio de la \'epoca colonial en el siglo XVI, cuyo reflejo es un amplio espectro racial que dificulta la investigaci\'on de la discriminaci\'on racial en el mercado laboral peruano. Asimismo, el Per\'u ha registrado un elevado y sostenido auge econ\'omico en la d\'ecada m\'as reciente, lo que har\'ia pensar en la dinamizaci\'on del mercado laboral y se esperar\'ia que las calificaciones de los potenciales empleados fueran las que primaran en la decisi\'on de contrataci\'on de los empleadores, dada la creciente competencia en el mercado laboral. Este proceso se deber\'ia producir con mayor dinamismo en el mercado de Lima, pues concentra al 35.2\% de la poblaci\'on econ\'omicamente activa (PEA) del Per\'u. Sin embargo, las encuestas de opini\'on y percepci\'on muestran lo contrario. El Informe del Latinobar\'ometro 2011 indica que en el Per\'u el 28\% de los encuestados se consideran dentro de un grupo discriminado, y que esa discriminaci\'on se orienta hacia la variable racial. Asimismo, el 39\% de los peruanos cree que existe discriminaci\'on por temas raciales. El presente trabajo investiga en qu\'e medida la menor participaci\'on de la poblaci\'on de origen ind\'igena en las ocupaciones t\'ecnicas, profesionales y de baja calificaci\'on se debe a un comportamiento discriminatorio de parte del empleador, y no a una menor productividad de dicho grupo. El m\'etodo usado consiste en enviar curr\'iculos de vida (CV) en respuesta a avisos reales de vacantes publicados en el diario m\'as prestigioso del pa\'is, agrupados en tres categor\'ias gen\'ericas de empleo: profesionales, t\'ecnicos y no calificados.},

  abstract = {The Tennessee class size project is a three-phase study designed to determine the effect of smaller class size in the earliest grades on short-term and long-term pupil performance. The first phase of this project, termed Project STAR (for Student-Teacher Achievement Ratio), was begun in 1985, when Lamar Alexander was governor of Tennessee. Governor Alexander, who later served as secretary of education in the cabinet of President George Bush, had made education a top priority for his second term. The legislature and the educational community of Tennessee were mindful of a promising study of the benefits of small class size carried out in nearby Indiana, but were also aware of the costs associated with additional classrooms and teachers. Wishing to obtain data on the effectiveness of reduced class size before committing additional funds, the Tennesse legislature authorized this four-year study in which results obtained in kindergarten, first, second, and third grade classrooms of 13 to 17 pupils were compared with those obtained in classrooms of 22 to 25 pupils and in classrooms of this larger size where the teacher was assisted by a paid aide. Both standardized and curriculum-based tests were used to assess and compare the performance of some 6,500 pupils in about 330 classrooms at approximately 80 schools in the areas of reading, mathematics, and basic study skills. After four years, it was clear that smaller classes did produce substantial improvement in early learning and cognitive studies and that the effect of small class size on the achievement of minority children was initially about double that observed for majority children, but in later years, it was about the same. The second phase of the project, called the Lasting Benefits Study, was begun in 1989 to determine whether these perceived benefits persisted. Observations made as a part of this phase confirmed that the children who were originally enrolled in smaller classes continued to perform better than their grade-mates (whose school experience had begun in larger classes) when they were returned to regular-sized classes in later grades. Under the third phase, Project Challenge, the 17 economically poorest school districts were given small classes in kindergarten, first, second, and third grades. These districts improved their end-of-year standing in rank among the 139 districts from well below average to above average in reading and mathematics. This article briefly summarizes the Tennessee class size project, a controlled experiment which is one of the most important educational investigations ever carried out and illustrates the kind and magnitude of research needed in the field of education to strengthen schools.},

  abstract = {We study race in the labor market by sending fictitious resumes to help-wanted ads in Boston and Chicago newspapers. To manipulate perceived race, resumes are randomly assigned African-American- or White-sounding names. White names receive 50 percent more callbacks for interviews. Callbacks are also more responsive to resume quality for White names than for African-American ones. The racial gap is uniform across occupation, industry, and employer size. We also find little evidence that employers are inferring social class from the names. Differential treatment by race still appears to still be prominent in the U. S. labor market.},
